                                                        <h1>Black Widow</h1>
                                                        <p class="major">Gifted spy Natasha Romanoff is more than worthy of her moniker, Black Widow.

Ruthless, efficient, and exceptionally skilled, Natasha strikes fear into the hearts of her enemies. Although she once operated on the side of evil, her innate heroism allowed her to overcome her upbringing and defect, setting her on a lifelong path of redemption.

A Hero of Our Time
Natasha Romanoff was born in the Soviet Union as Natalia Alianovna Romanova (Наталия Альяновна Романова). Although her exact parentage is unknown, it is rumored that she is related to the late Romanov dynasty—the former rulers of Russia—but those claims have so far been unproven. Orphaned as a child, she was rescued during an attack on Stalingrad by a man named Ivan Petrovitch Bezukhov, who looked after and trained the girl.

As she grew older, Natasha’s talents caught the attention of Soviet Intelligence, soon to be known as the KGB, and was recruited into their ranks. During World War II, Natasha was kidnapped by the Hand, who sought to make her a brainwashed master assassin. Luckily, she was rescued by Steve Rogers (Captain America) and Logan (who would later become Wolverine). During the War, the young Natasha served in the Russian army where she fell in love with another young soldier named Nikolai. Despite their initial happiness, their union did not end blissfully. Nikolai was killed in the war and the baby girl they conceived did not survive birth.

Following World War II, Natasha progressed into the Black Widow Program, where young girls like her were conditioned to become sleeper agents. Trained at a facility called the Red Room, Natasha was also enhanced with the Soviets’ version of the Super-Soldier serum, gifting her with peak human strength and stamina, as well as resistance to disease and slowed-down aging. Natasha has memories of studying to be a ballerina as a cover during this time. However, because her psyche was tampered with by the government, it is unclear if she actually was ever a ballerina, or these memories were implanted.

As her Black Widow training progressed, she encountered (and romanced) Captain America’s former best friend and sidekick, James Buchanan Barnes, who had been brainwashed into the becoming the assassin known as the Winter Soldier. Their relationship didn’t last long as she was set up to marry Alexei Shostakov, a renowned test pilot. Though they had a happy marriage, the KGB faked his death during an experimental rocket test in order to make him into the Red Guardian, the USSR’s version of Captain America, a hero who would represent and defend the nation.

Natasha’s grief over his death drove her further into the clutches and control of the Red Room Academy and she finally earned the title of Black Widow.

Although she initially worked against the Avengers and United States on the behest of her superiors, Natasha ended up defecting to join S.H.I.E.L.D. and later the Avengers to become a true Super Hero

                                                        <h2>Captain America</h2>
                                                        <p>From the dark days of world war to the explosive challenges of today, Super-Soldier Captain America stands ready as a shining sentinel of liberty to shield the oppressed and fight for freedom everywhere.

Ninety-Eight-Pound Weakling
A poor orphan from the wrong side of the tracks in the days leading up to World War II, goodhearted Steve Rogers enlisted in the army to fight the Axis Powers, but met with rejection due to his small size and underdeveloped physique. Professor Abraham Erskine, a pioneer in the development of a Super-Soldier for the United States, saw potential in Rogers and whisked him into Project Rebirth, the professor’s bold experiment in enhancing the human body to its peak powers.

Rogers found himself subjected to Erskine’s treatments— a specialized serum and exposure to a unique form of radiation—and realized the professor’s dream, becoming the world’s first, fully developed Super-Soldier. Now muscular and tall, as well as possessed of amazing strength and agility, the former ninety-eight-pound weakling watched in horror as a Nazi spy shot and killed Erskine, and thereby ensured Rogers would be the last of his kind.



The United States government moved swiftly to fashion Rogers into a living symbol of inspiration to the public at home and soldiers abroad. And, after extensive combat training he debuted in a colorful, patriotic uniform as Captain America. Operating out of the army’s Camp Lehigh in Virginia, Rogers posed as an ordinary soldier, but conducted secret missions stateside and abroad as his alter-ego to smash spies, saboteurs, and the occasional Super Villain who threatened the country he loved so dearly. Soon, Cap captured the attention of the Red Skull, his evil counterpart in Germany, and the two formed a lasting enmity over the course of the war. The hero also gained a near-indestructible shield with which he became supremely efficient in both offense and defense.

                                                        <h2>Hawkeye</h2>
                                                        <p>Earth’s Mightiest Marksman, Clint Barton employs a devil-may-care attitude and mastery over one of civilization’s oldest weapons as the Avengers’ ace archer, Hawkeye. A mainstay of the hero team, Barton brings along an undying heroic spirit and the ability to hit any target.

Stringing the Bow
Orphaned at an early age, Clint Barton and his brother Barney escaped an oppressive orphanage and ran away to join the circus—the Carson Carnival of Traveling Wonders. The youth fell under the sway of the Swordsman, a charismatic fellow performer who teamed up with the talented Trick Shot and trained his young charge to be an expert with a bow and arrow. When Barton found his mentor embezzling funds from the show, he attempted to alert the authorities. But, instead, he suffered a beating from his roguish role model, bringing the apprenticeship to a violent end.

Recovering, but separated from both Swordsman and Barney, Clint continued to hone his archery aptitude, taking the name Hawkeye and wandering the world joining several circuses as he searched for greater purpose. Inspiration struck when Barton witnessed Iron Man in action and decided he would use his unique skill set to become a costumed Super Hero. Unfortunately for the would-be do-gooder, his initial outing ended in a misunderstanding that saw him labeled a criminal.

Before Barton could correct public perception, destiny brought him in contact with The Black Widow. The brave bow slinger immediately fell in love with the sultry spy. Using his attraction to manipulate the smitten archer, Widow set him against her nemesis, Iron Man. The duo clashed several times with the Armored Avenger before the Russian suffered an injury and escaped, leaving Hawkeye to reconsider his path and attempt to get back on the straight and narrow.

A chance encounter changed Hawkeye’s fortunes, as the bowman saved butler Edwin Jarvis and his mother from a mugger, earning him the gratitude of a key Avengers ally and an opportunity to align with Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. With Captain America recruiting a revamped roster for the team, Jarvis arranged for Clint to audition before Iron Man, impressing his old enemy and gaining his sponsorship. Hawkeyes would join Cap, Quicksilver, and The Scarlet Witch as the Avengers’ second generation, kicking off a long and distinguished tenure with the team.

A Living Weapon
Nobody in the Marvel Universe comes close to matching Clint Barton when it comes to skilled marksmanship. Though he can easily make use of almost any weapon thanks to extensive training with Swordsman, Trick Shot, Captain America, and others, Hawkeye prefers his trademark bow. The Avenging Archer also employs an arsenal of trick arrows, including shafts that emit everything from smoke and knockout gas to a powerful electromagnetic pulse.

Even stripped of his tools, Hawkeye packs a punch, having mastered the martial arts and hand-to-hand combat, thanks to his friend and mentor Captain America.

During a brief stint under the codename Goliath, Barton makes use of fellow Avenger Hank Pym’s size-changing Pym particles to grow to giant-size. Years later, Clint takes on the masked identity of Ronin, proving adept at swordplay and melee fighting, but he always returns to his array of arrows.

Hawkeye’s most adaptable asset may be his keen mind, honed to a point as sharp as any arrowhead, thanks to years learning from other skilled leaders. Clint has captained his own Avengers teams on multiple occasions, as well as taking the reformed criminal Thunderbolts under his wing in hopes of helping the one-time rogues to follow his road to redemption. Barton possesses a sophisticated savvy that belies his blustery attitude, able to game plan calculated courses of attack and quarterback his troops in battle.

Hard Targets
Early on in his tenure as an Avenger, Hawkeye contends with the unwelcome return of an old foe in the form of The Swordsman, who claims he had reformed like his pupil and seeks to join the heroic alliance. Barton warns his teammates of their new recruit’s duplicity, and ultimately has his suspicions confirmed when Swordsman turns on the team, capturing Captain America; the archer defeats his one-time teacher in combat and manages to exorcise that particular demon of his past.

During a period where Clint leaves the Avengers, he takes a job as security chief at Cross Technological Enterprises, but uncovers corruption within the organization, pitting him against the villain Crossfire. Hawkeyes and new ally Mockingbird triumph over their adversary. This comes at the cost of the former’s hearing, as he uses a sonic arrow at close range to thwart his foe. Crossfire would return, seeking revenge on the duo who undid him, but the unlikely aid of aged actress Moira Brandon help the heroes triumph once more.

More than once in recent times, Clint contends with roguish imposters seeking to co-opt some aspect of his identity. During his “Dark Reign,” Norman Osborn dubs the psychotic Bullseye as his “Hawkeye” on a team of twisted Avengers, leaving Barton as Ronin to storm the villains’ headquarters and attempt to take down the operation himself; ultimately Mockingbird and others come to the marksman’s rescue. Later, Baron Zemo, who blames Barton for taking leadership of the Thunderbolts from him, sets Clint’s own brother, Barney, against him as the new Trickshot. After several skirmishes between the siblings, they ultimately reconcile and the elder Barton assists Hawkeye in defending his New York apartment building against the Russian mob.

Avenging Allies
Clint Barton finds a surrogate family and the stable home he lacked through his early years as a stalwart member of the Avengers. Though Hawkeye clashes with Captain America when they first meet—the brash youth questioning the leadership of the seasoned super soldier—the two ultimately form a close bond, with Cap taking on the role of first mentor and later proud peer. The archer also counts former enemy Iron Man and the temporarily time-displaced Two-Gun Kid among his closest confidantes within the ranks of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes.

Our merry marksman doubles as a hopeless romantic and has fallen for more than one of his teammates. His initial dalliance with Black Widow convinces the Soviet to reform; though the two have rekindled their affair more than once over the years, they find firmer footing as friends. Upon joining the Avengers, Hawkeye pines for The Scarlet Witch, earning the ire of her twin brother, Quicksilver. Clint even quits the team when Wanda Maximoff chooses the android Vision over him, but all parties eventually reconcile. After only one adventure alongside the magnificent Mockingbird, a smitten Clint proposes marriage to beautiful Bobbi Morse, and the duo go west together to found a new team of Avengers. Unfortunately, the honeymoon does not last forever, and these two strong-willed heroes aren’t able to make their marriage work, though they always have each other’s backs.

Perhaps nobody understands the Avenging Archer better than his protégé and namesake Kate Bishop, AKA Hawkeye too. Though mentoring a successor would mark maturity for most, more often than not Clint learns lessons from this extraordinary young woman, as much as vice versa. The two have been estranged on more than one occasion, stemming from conflicting philosophies when it comes to mission objectives. But, inevitably, they always reconcile, two straight arrows that fly true together.</p>

This holds true for other heroic groups like the Avengers, Fantastic Four, Defenders and Inhumans as well. Magneto has also had run ins with Hydra and given his upbringing always remained their opposition. The entire United States Government also lands on the foe list—which makes sense considering the amount of times Magneto has threatened, destroyed, or held something hostage in an attempt to take control of the world at large.

Attracted Allies

Magneto’s allies tend to fluctuate, but the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and Acolytes have established their places as support groups. Charles Xavier and the X-Men occasionally fall into this category as well, though they always remain wary. And finally the New Mutants, Hellfire Club, Savage Land Mutates and High Evolutionary have all found themselves backing this magnetic madman at some point in his long and complicated run.</p>

                                                        <h2>Wolverine</h2>
                                                        <p>A Long History
James Howlett was born to wealthy John and Elizabeth Howlett in Alberta, Canada, during the last years of the 19th century. As a child, he was frail and unhealthy due to his overactive mutant immune system and was neglected by his mother, who had been institutionalized following the death of her first son, John Jr., in 1897. James’s mutant abilities were triggered when his father was shot by the Howlett groundskeeper Thomas Logan, whom he did not know was his real father. James killed Logan, slashed the face of Logan’s son and his friend Dog, and left Alberta with a childhood friend, Rose O’Hara.

His healing abilities drove trauma from his memories, leaving him partially amnesiac. He and Rose found refuge at a British Columbia stone quarry, where Rose, claiming James was her cousin, gave his name as “Logan.” Within months, Logan’s powers were heightening due to the environment around him. He became healthier and gained senses to rival those of an animal, but also became more violent. To divert some of this pent-up rage, Logan partook in cage fights where his prowess earned him the nickname “Wolverine.” After accidentally killing Rose with his claws, Logan retreated into the woods where he lived as a feral beast, losing all of his former memories.

He would later reenter society and travel the world, partaking in every major conflict of the 20th century (WWI, WWII, the Spanish Civil War, the Vietnam War) as a soldier, criminal, or mercenary for hire. This caused him to coin the phrase "I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice.”

While on the run from the law, he was abducted by the Canadian super soldier program known as “Weapon X.” He had previously been a willing participant in the program in the early 1960s as an international operative of Team X. Logan was a prime candidate for this new iteration of Weapon X due to his incredibly fast healing and endurance, which allowed Doctor Cornelius and his team to fuse adamantium to his skeleton. The experiment was successful and gave Logan more control over his berserker nature, but also wiped him of any residual memories he had lingering in his head.

When the Hulk blundered his way into Canadian territory, Logan was mobilized against the green gargantuan. He was also used to kill the entire population of a small town in a field test, but eventually broke loose from his captors, slaying almost everyone at the Weapon X facility. Despite this, they still had his DNA and were able to create new mutants like Avery Connor and clawed clone called X-23 (aka Laura Kinney).

His real sense of belonging would not arrive until he joined the X-Men.

The Snikt List
Wolverine’s enemies are numerous and it is often hard not to blame them. After all, he is a hard guy to get along with.

However, an adversary, with abilities to match Logan’s, is Victor Creed (AKA Sabertooth) who also has retractable claws and healing factor. The two first clashed in Japan with Logan coming out on top and leaving Creed for dead, unaware that he had regenerative powers as well. Creed is an operative of the mastermind Romulus, ruler of the wolf-like Lupine and a worldwide criminal empire. Two of Wolverine’s maternal uncles, Elias and Frederick Hudson, work for him, although he is unaware of it. Romulus kept an eye on Logan for a good portion of his life and mentally manipulated him at times.

Logan’s Heroes
While a brief member of the Canadian Super Hero team known as Alpha Flight, Wolverine joins the X-Men at the behest of Professor Charles Xavier. This is his most iconic home and the place where he enters into an on-again, off-again relationship with telepath Jean Grey. Her existing relationship with Scott Summers (AKA Cyclops), however, creates a complex love triangle between all three.</p>
